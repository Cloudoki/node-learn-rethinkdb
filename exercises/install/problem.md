Now before we start let's make sure we have RethinkDB installed.

To move on to the next task run `learnrethinkdb verify`

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Hints

* Follow the instructions on this page: https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/

To verify that RethinkDB is installed, you can try running `rethinkdb --version`.

If you are on Windows, you will need to use `rethinkdb.exe` instead,
make sure that is in your `PATH` variable.
