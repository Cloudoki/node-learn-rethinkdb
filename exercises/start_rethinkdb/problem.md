# Start a RethinkDB server instance.

Now that we have RethinkDB installed let's start it.

-----------------------------------------------------------
## TASK

To start an instance of RethinkDB, run `rethinkdb`.

Then, in another terminal, run `npm install rethinkdb` to install the RethinkDB
 client library.

To complete this exercise run `learnrethinkdb verify`. It will attempt to
connect to RethinkDB on `localhost` and on the default port `28015`.

If this lesson is passed, be sure to leave `rethinkdb` running as it will
be used for the remainder of the exercise.

## Additional Information

Take a moment to browse the RethinkDB Adminstration Console:

* http://localhost:8080

For instructions on how to start the RethinkDB as a service on startup or to run
multiple RethinkdB instances, which is not covered in this workshop, you may
want take a look into this guide:
