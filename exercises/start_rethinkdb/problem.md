Start a RethinkDB instance

-----------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To start an instance of RethinkDB, run `rethinkdb`.

Then, in another terminal, run `npm install rethinkdb` to install the RethinkDB
 client library.

To complete this exercise run `learnrethinkdb verify`, it will attempt to
connect to RethinkDB.

Take a moment to browse the RethinkDB Adminstration Console:
* http://localhost:8000

If this lesson is passed, be sure to leave `rethinkdb` running as it will
be used for the remainder of the exercise.
