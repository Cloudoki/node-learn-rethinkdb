### What is RethinkDB?

> RethinkDB is the first open-source, scalable JSON database built from the
> ground up for the realtime web. It inverts the traditional database architecture
> by exposing an exciting new access model – instead of polling for changes,
> the developer can tell RethinkDB to continuously push updated query results
> to applications in realtime. RethinkDB’s realtime push architecture
> dramatically reduces the time and effort necessary to build scalable realtime
> apps.
